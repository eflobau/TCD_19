    "### Why probability ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is inherently a statistical subject. When analyzing large amounts of data we need to know how randomness could affect our observations and how sure can we be about a certain conclusion given our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "One could also argue that an important subject to learn from would be linear algebra as it is the basis for most of the manipulations that are working under the hood in the machine learning models we will see in the next module. While this is true, this workshop is not focused solely on machine learning, but on data science as a whole. Therefore, I think that a proper refreshing on probability and statistics is necessary for a better understanding of the types of things we can do with data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability can indeed be a very hard subject because of the inherent mathematical and conceptual complexity behind it. However, we will take a very practical approach and see how we can use the tools from probability and statistics to get a better sense of our data, through the abstraction into certain \"summary statistics\" and to develop an intuition to understand the models we'll use in the next module and to  create more complex mathematical models in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is because of this complexity that it was hard for me to even design this module as I'm trying to re-learn probability and statistics to delve into bayesian inference, information theory, statitstical physics and stochastic modeling of genetic circuits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Distinction between bayesian and frequentist statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilities take values between 0 and 1, where 0 means impossibility and 1 means certainty. However, there are two ways of thinking of probabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Frequentists : Think of how classical stats courses are taught. The frequentist conception of probability $P(A)$of an event A is \n",
    "\n",
    "represents a long-run frequency over a\n",
    "large number of identical repetitions of an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P(A) = \\frac{ \\text{number of outcomes that favour event A}}{\\text{total number of outcomes}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian: bayesian stats in the other hand, \"guesses\" a probability in terms of our confidence that a given event might happen, and updates that guess with the more data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian inference allows us to have an intuition like the following image: \n",
    "\n",
    "While bayesian inference is beyond the scope of this course, you can readily see that bayesian inference is the more \"common\" thing for us humans to think of probabilities. We tend to think of a certain event given the information we know. This beautiful visualization captions our way of thinking."
